# Coding-Raja-Technologies-Internship

**Name:** Rishik Kurkiya

**Task:** Machine Learning Internship Task 2
I have implemented The Task -- **IMAGE CLASSIFICATION FOR FOOD RECOGNITION** on the Food41 dataset available on keggle. 
For this, I have implemented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) machine learning model.
You can find the code for this task in the Food_Classification.ipynb file uploaded in the repository, (Note that the dataset in the .ipynb file is impored from my drive, in order to run it you will have to download dataset from keggle)

NOTE  that I have uploaded both .ipynb files for both tasks.
